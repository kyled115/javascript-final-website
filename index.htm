					<td bgcolor="white">mPhone combines three products — a vintage rotary phone, 
				a low-res vintage mPod with hard-button controls, 
				and a breakthrough Internet communications device (within 1 metre of a wireless access point only) 
				with snail mail, web browsing (when connected to a computer), maps storage pocket, and searching 
				(special tiny magnifying glass) — into one decent-sized and semi-lightweight handheld device. 
				mPhone also introduces an entirely new user interface based on historical telegraph machines 
				used by Marconi, letting you control everything with just your fingers. So it ushers in an era 
				of software power and sophistication never before seen in a mobile device, completely redefining 
				what you can do on a mobile phone.
